My name is Vincenzo Pomponi.
I am currently an external PhD student at [Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI)](https://www.usi.ch/en), Lugano, Switzerland. Also, I am a researcher at [University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI)](https://www.supsi.ch/en/home), in the [Automation Robotics and Machines Laboratory (ARM lab)](https://www.supsi.ch/en/web/isteps/automation-robotics-and-machines), supervised by [Prof. Anna Valente](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pO9TbIMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
Before starting my PhD, I received my BS and MS degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the [Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi)](https://www.mecheng.polimi.it/?lang=en).
I completed my master’s thesis in collaboration with [Institute of Intelligent Industrial Technologies and Systems for Advanced Manufacturing (STIIMA-CNR)](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/?lang=en) under the supervision of [Dr. Hamiz-Reza Karimi](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=YcTS0ZMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Loris Roveda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3un_pPgAAAAJ&hl=en). The thesis focused on implementing an Active Preference Learning (APL) algorithm to optimize the robot’s end-effector pose in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) while simultaneously improving the human operator’s posture through real-time ergonomic assessments. The article detailing the methodology and results of this work is available at [A framework for human–robot collaboration enhanced by preference learning and ergonomics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073658452400067X).

My research lies at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Generative AI, and Robotics. I am interested in building robust, scalable, and open-source algorithms for Learning from Demonstration (LfD).
