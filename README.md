My name is Vincenzo Pomponi.
I am currently an external PhD student at [Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI)](https://www.usi.ch/en), Lugano, and I am a researcher at [University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI)](https://www.supsi.ch/en/home), Lugano, Switzerland.
Before starting my PhD, I received my BS and MS degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the [Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi)](https://www.mecheng.polimi.it/?lang=en).
I did my master's thesis in collaboration with [Institute of Intelligent Industrial Technologies and Systems for Advanced Manufacturing (STIIMA-CNR)](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/?lang=en) under the supervision of [Dr. Hamiz-Reza Karimi](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=YcTS0ZMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Loris Roveda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3un_pPgAAAAJ&hl=en). The focus of the work was the implementation of an Active Preference Learning (APL) algorithm to optimize both the robot's end-effector pose during a Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) and enhance the posture of the human operator through an online ergonomics assessment.
The article explaining the methodology and the results of the work can be found at "[A framework for human–robot collaboration enhanced by preference learning and ergonomics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073658452400067X)".

My research lies at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Generative AI, and Robotics. I am interested in building robust, scalable, and open-source algorithms for Learning from Demonstration (LfD).
