I am an external PhD student at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Lugano, and I am a researcher at University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), Lugano, Switzerland.
Before starting my PhD, I received my BS and MS degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi).

My research lies at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Generative AI, and Robotics. I am interested in building robust, scalable, and open-source algorithms for Learning from Demonstration (LfD).
